# clinical-conductor-integration

Core implementation in `src/api/client.py` handles specialized integration with Clinical Conductor's clinical trial data API:

## OData Query Management
- Custom handling of OData syntax for clinical trial queries
- Query parameter translation for trial-specific data structures
- Field-level access control based on tenant permissions

## Clinical Data Pagination
- Specialized pagination handling for large clinical datasets
- Multi-page result aggregation with clinical data validation
- Batch size optimization for trial data synchronization

## Multi-tenant Controls
- Instance-specific credential management
- Tenant-aware API endpoint routing
- Segregated clinical data access patterns

## Production Safety Controls
- Rate limiting for Clinical Conductor API endpoints
- Clinical data validation before transmission
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for clinical data requests
- Tenant-specific API throttling controls

## Business Rules
- Clinical trial data synchronization patterns
- Multi-tenant clinical data source isolation
- Compliance tracking for data access
- Environment-specific safety thresholds

Importance Score: 80/100
Key Integration Point: Serves as primary interface for clinical trial data extraction
