# Data-Flow

## Primary Data Flow Components

### API Ingestion Layer (src/api/client.py)
- Clinical Conductor OData API integration for trial data extraction
- Multi-tenant credential management for separate clinical trial instances
- Instance-specific rate limiting and pagination controls
Importance Score: 80/100

### Staging Layer (src/db/loader.py)
- Clinical data staging with JSONB record handling
- Source-based deduplication for clinical trial records
- Data lineage tracking for clinical provenance
Importance Score: 75/100

### Orchestration Layer (src/etl/orchestrator.py)
- DAG-based clinical data flow management
- Parallel execution with tenant isolation
- Parameterized incremental loading patterns
Importance Score: 85/100

## Data Flow Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Flow
1. Instance-specific API credentials retrieved
2. Clinical data extracted per tenant context
3. Isolated staging areas per clinical instance
4. Tenant-aware warehouse loading

### Incremental Loading
1. Last-modified tracking per clinical dataset
2. Delta detection at source level
3. Incremental staging with deduplication
4. Transactional batch commits

### Data Lineage
1. Source system identification
2. Clinical trial record provenance
3. Transformation tracking
4. Load history for compliance
