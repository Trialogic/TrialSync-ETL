---


# etl-orchestration

## Core Orchestration Engine (src/etl/orchestrator.py)
- DAG-based execution system specialized for clinical trial data flows
- Custom dependency validation enforcing clinical data consistency rules
- Parallel execution with isolation between tenant-specific data streams
- Incremental load patterns for large clinical datasets
- Parameter management for trial-specific data extraction

Key Features:
- Clinical trial-aware dependency resolution
- Multi-tenant execution isolation
- Failure boundary containment per trial
- Data lineage tracking across job steps

Business Logic Scoring: 85/100

## Job Management (src/etl/scheduler.py)
- Clinical compliance-oriented scheduling rules
- Environment-specific safety controls for production trial data
- Schedule persistence with trial-specific configurations
- Execution history tracking for regulatory compliance
- Multi-tenant scheduling isolation

Key Features:
- Trial-specific execution windows
- Compliance audit logging
- Environment-aware safety controls
- Run history preservation

Business Logic Scoring: 70/100

## Clinical Data Flow Patterns
