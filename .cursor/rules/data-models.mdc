## Clinical Trial Data Structures (Importance: 85/100)

The data models are centered around JSONB-based clinical trial record structures with emphasis on:

- Clinical data-specific JSONB record schemas
- Multi-tenant data isolation patterns
- Source system identifiers for deduplication
- Data lineage tracking fields

Key implementation in `src/db/loader.py`:
- Clinical trial record deduplication based on source IDs
- Data provenance tracking for clinical record lineage
- Transactional batch record handling

## Data Lineage Implementation (Importance: 80/100)

Lineage tracking focuses on:
- Clinical data provenance capture
- Source system reference preservation
- Multi-tenant data segregation

Core components:
- Source ID-based deduplication logic
- Clinical trial data provenance fields
- Tenant-specific data isolation structures

## Source Data Schemas (Importance: 75/100)

Clinical trial data structures include:
- Clinical Conductor OData record formats
- Tenant-specific data partitioning
- Lineage metadata fields
- Source system reference mappings
